# Nonogram
This program is a nonogram that allows the user to input any image, which is then resized to a user-defined size and binarized. The binarized image is converted to a nonogram puzzle.

Nonogram puzzles involve a square play board, that is further divided into small squares. Numbers beside each row and on top of each column show the number of filled squares in each corresponding row/column. Multiple numbers imply clusters that are separated by blank squares.

For example, in the image below, the first row contains 4 consecutive filled squares with no blank squares in between. The second row also contains a total of 4 filled squares, however, these are broken up into 2 clusters of 2 consecutive filled squares each, with the clusters separated by at least one blank square.

A game in progress and the finished game board are shown below. A selected square is filled with green. Users can also 'flag' squares that they think should be left blank by right-clicking on the square. These are flagged squares are filled with grey.
